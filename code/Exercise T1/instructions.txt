A.
1. The code to be executed by a thread has an array defined as follows:
char [ ] list = {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’};
A thread that executes this code outputs in a loop the string “I am thread #”
followed by its assigned number, which is followed by an element of this array. It 
takes a delay of 2 seconds before displaying the next element.
Write this code by defining the subclass ExerciseT1A1 of the class Thread as 
follows:
⎯ This class has the instance variable: int threadNum; to hold the thread 
number.
⎯ The constructor ExerciseT1A1( int number ) is used to instantiate a thread
object and also to set its number.
2. The code to be executed by a thread outputs in a loop the string “I am thread #”
followed by its assigned number, which is followed by 10, then 20, then 30, then 
40, and 50 with a delay of 3 second before displaying the next value.
Write this code by defining the subclass ExerciseT1A2 of the class Thread as 
follows:
⎯ This class has the instance variable: int threadNum; to hold the thread 
number.
⎯ The constructor ExerciseT1A2( int number ) is used to instantiate a thread 
object and also set its number.
3. Using the class ExerciseT1A, write a program that runs a thread that executes the 
code in the class ExerciseT1A1, and another thread that executes the code in the 
class ExerciseT1A2
B. 
1. Write the code in question A.1 by using the class ExerciseT1B1 that implements 
the interface Runnable.
2. Write the code in question A.2 by using the class ExerciseT1B2 that implements 
the interface Runnable.
3. Using the class ExerciseT1B, write a program that runs a thread that executes the 
code in the class ExerciseT1B1, and another thread that executes the code in the 
class ExerciseT1B2

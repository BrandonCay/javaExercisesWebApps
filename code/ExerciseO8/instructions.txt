Exercise O4
Using the class Date that you defined in Exercise O3, write the definition of the class named Employee with the following private instance variables:
first name                  -        class string
last name          -        class string 
ID number                 -        integer  (the default ID number is 999999)
birth day          -        class Date 
date hired                  -        class Date
base pay          -        double precision  (the default base pay is  $0.00)

The default constructor initializes the first name to "john", the last name to "Doe", and the
 birth day and hired day to the default date (1/1/1960).

In addition to the constructors, the class has the following public instance methods:

void readPInfo(Scanner scan ) that uses the Scanner object parameter to read the values for the 
instance variables first name, last name, ID number, birth day, and date of hire.

void readPayInfo(Scanner scan ) that uses the Scanner object parameter to read the value
 for the base pay instance variable. 
 
String getPInfoString( ) that returns a string in the following format:
              NAME: <lastName  +  ", "  +   firstName>
              ID NUMBER:  <Id-Number>
               BIRTH DAY: <string-birth-day>
DATE HIRED: < string-date-hired >

void  setBpay( double newBpay )  that sets the value of the base pay to the new value, newBpay.

 double getBpay(  )  that returns the value of the base pay instance variable.
 
double getGpay(  )  that returns the value of the gross pay (which is the base pay).

double computeTax(   )  that computes the tax deduction on the gross pay and returns it as follows:
If gross pay is greater than or equal to 1000, 20% of the gross pay;
If  800 <= gross pay <  1000, 18% of gross pay
If  600 <= gross pay < 800, 15% of gross pay
Otherwise, 10 % of the gross pay.
 
String getPayInfoString( ) that returns a string in the following format:
              GROSS PAY: <gross-pay>
              TAX DEDUCTION:  <tax-deduction>
               NET PAY: <Net-pay>

Define another class named ExerciseO4 that contains the method main that does the following:
Define an object and instantiate it with the default constructor, then output its personal information (by calling the instance methods getPInfoString( ).
Define an object and initialize its instance variables as follows:
John   Doe   111111   10/25/1990   11/15/2010  750.00

And then output its personal and pay information (by calling the instance methods getPInfoString( ) 
and getPayInfoString( )).

Define an object, read its personal and pay information 
(by calling the methods readPInfo(Scanner scan ) and readPayInfo(Scanner scan )) , and then output its personal and pay information (by calling the instance methods getPInfoString( ) and getPayInfoString( )).
Define an object and instantiate it (or read the values for its instance variables) with an invalid date (date of birth or date of hire).

Exercise O8

Write the definition of the subclass of class Employee (that you defined in Exercise O4) named BonusEmployee as follows:
It has one additional private instance variable named bonus (double precision) with the default value $0.0.
In addition to the constructors, it has the following public instance methods:
double getBonus( void )                 that returns the value of the instance variable bonus.

Instance method void readPayInfo(Scanner scan ) is overridden in the class BonusEmploye:  it now reads the values for the instance variables base pay and bonus.
Instance method double getGpay(   ) is overridden in the class BonusEmploye:  it now returns the sum of the value of the instance variable base pay and the value of the instance variable bonus.
Instance method String getPayInfoString( ) is overridden in the class BonusEmploye:  it returns a string in the following format:
BASE PAY:  <base-pay>

BONUS:  <bonus>

              GROSS PAY: <gross-pay>

              TAX DEDUCTION:  <tax-deduction>

               NET PAY: <Net-pay>

Define the class Exercise O8 with the method main(  ) that is used to test your class as follows:
Method main first defines an object of the class Employee with the default values for its instance variables, and then prints its personal and pay information.
It defines an object of the class BonusEmployee with the default values for its instance variables, and then prints its personal and pay information.
It initializes an object of the class Employee  as follows: first name: “John”;  last name: “Doe”; ID #: 111111; Date of birth: 10/ 25/1991; Date of hire: 5/10/2010; and base pay: $1250; and then prints its personal and pay information.
It initializes an object of the class BonusEmployee as follows: first name: “Jobe”; last name: “Daly”; ID #: 222222; Date of birth: 1/ 5/1990; Date of hire: 6/30/2011; base pay: $850; and bonus: $250; then prints its personal and pay information.
It reads the personal and pay information of an object of the class Employee, and then outputs its personal and pay information.
It then reads the personal and pay information of an object of the class BonusEmployee and then outputs its personal and pay information.

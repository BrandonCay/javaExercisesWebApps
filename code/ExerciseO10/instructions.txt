Exercise O10 (extra credit)

Write the definition of the derived class of class Employee (that you defined in Exercise O4) named HourlyEmployee as follows:
It has three additional instance variables named hours (integer) and payRate (double precision), and overtime (double precision).  Their default values are 0 for hours, and $0.00 for payRate and overtime.
It also has a private instance method void computeBaseOvertimePay(   ) that computes the base pay and the overtime pay as follows:
If the value of the instance variable hours is less than or equal to 35, then it does the following:
Set the value of the inherited instance variable base pay to payRate times hours.
Set the value of the instance variable overtime to 0.00.
Otherwise, it does the following:
 Set the value of the inherited instance variable base pay to payRate times 35.
Set the value of the instance variable overtime to payRate times 1.5 times (hours – 35).
The constructor with parameters has the following method header:
          HourlyEmployee( string fn, string ln, int iD, Date bd, Date hd, int hrs, double prate)

                    Where hrs represents the number of hours of work and prate the pay rate.

It calls class Employee’s constructor with 0 as the argument for the data member base pay, and then calls the private instance method computeBaseOvertimePay(   ) to set the values of the instance variables base pay and overtime.

In addition to the constructors, it has the following public instance methods:
int getHours( void )                       returns the value of the data member hours.
double getPayRate( void )    returns the value of the data member payRate.
double getOvertime( void )   returns the value of the data member overtime.
Instance method void readPayInfo(Scanner scan ) is overridden in the class HourlyEmployee:  it now reads the values of the instance variables hours and payRate, and then calls the private instance method computeBaseOvertimePay(   ) to set the values of the instance variables base pay and overtime.
Instance method  double getGpay(   ) is overridden in the class HourlyEmployee:  it now returns the sum of the values of the instance variables base pay and overtime.
 

Instance method String getPayInfoString( ) is overridden in the class HourlyEmployee:  it returns a string in the following format:
HOURS:  <hours>

PAY RATE:  <pay-rate>

BASE PAY:  <base-pay>

OVERTIME:  <overtime>

              GROSS PAY: <gross-pay>

              TAX DEDUCTION:  <tax-deduction>

               NET PAY: <Net-pay>

Define the class Exercise O10 with the method main that is used to test your class as follows:
Function main first defines an object of the class HourlyEmployee with the default values for its instance variables, and then prints its personal and pay information.
It initializes an object of the class HourlyEmployee as follows: first name: "Mark"; last name: "Peter"; ID #: 333333; Date of birth: 1/10/1995; Date of hire: 7/10/2012; hours: 50; and pay rate: $25; then prints its personal and pay information.
It initializes an object of the class HourlyEmployee as follows: first name: "Jane"; last name: "Doe"; ID #: 444444; Date of birth: 10/1/1998; Date of hire: 5/10/2011; hours: 30; and pay rate: $20; then prints its personal and pay information.
It then reads the personal and pay information of an object of the class HourlyEmployee and then outputs its personal and pay information.

Example T6
The application in this example consists of one Java class file with the following:
The class SynchBlock
o that implements the Runnable interface with the code that is used by three 
threads to concurrently access the instance variables
− StringBuffer buffer and 
− int counter
(whose access should be synchronized) on an object.
o Each thread 
− creates a message that includes the current value of the instance variable 
counter, 
− waits one tenth of a second, and then
− append the message to the buffer and then 
− adds one to the current value of the instance variable counter.
This file also contain the code of the main thread that 
o creates, 
o starts, and 
o waits for all three threads to terminate.
Note
1.The class StringBuffer is a Java class that is provided to represent strings. It also has 
methods to perform the basic operations on strings
2.The static method void getProperty( String key ) of the class System 
a. Takes as a parameter the name of a system propert (key), and 
b. returns the string value of the system property.
c. When the key is “line.separator" , 
it returns the string “\n” in UNIX and “\r\n” in MS Windows systems.

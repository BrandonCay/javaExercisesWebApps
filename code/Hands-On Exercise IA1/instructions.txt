1. Type and execute the program LocalHostDemo.
2. Modify the program LocalHostDemo so that it determines and displays the IP 
address in byte format as follows: 
A[0] A[1] A[2] A[3]. For example: 127 45 9 2.
Note that a byte value is represented in binary two’s complement: a positive value (00 
– 7F is represented by its binary representations whereas a negative value V (80 – FF) 
is the binary representation of 256 – V.

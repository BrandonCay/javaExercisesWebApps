Write the definition of the class named Score1 with the following private instance variables:
  first name and last name (objects of the class String); course name (object of class String); 
  and an array of 5 test scores (double). 

The default constructor (constructor without parameters) initializes the String instance 
variables to null and the elements of the array to 0.0. 

The constructor with parameters Score1( String fname, String lname, String courseNum, double[ ] list) 
initializes the array of test scores with the values of the elements of another array of 5 elements 
that is passed to it as an argument.   

In addition to the constructors, it has the following public instance methods:  

double computeAverage(  ) that computes the average score,  
void read(Scanner scan ) that uses the Scanner object parameter to read the first name, last name, course name,
 and the 5 test scores into the array, and
void print( ) that outputs the first name, last name, course name, the test scores, and the average test score. 

Write the definition of the class ExerciseO6 with the main method that does the following:
Define an object of the class Score1 and initialize it with the default constructor.
Use the read method to read values into the instance variables of this object.
Use the print method to output the first name, last name, course name, the test scores, and the average test score of this object.
Read the last name, first name, course name, and the 5 test scores into an array and use this information to define and instantiate an object of the class Score1. 
Use the print method to output the last name, first name, course name, the test scores, and the average test score of this object.

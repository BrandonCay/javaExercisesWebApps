Write a program that consists of the class named ExerciseC2 with the method main that does the following:
Create an HashMap with a String key and an Integer value with an initial capacity of 16 named mapC2.
Read ten pairs of names and integer values and add them into mapC2
Read a name and output its corresponding value.
Output the list of the key-value pairs by using an enhanced for-loop on the set of keys
Output the list of the key-value pairs by using an Iterator object on the set of keys
 Remove from the map all the pairs with an even value
Output the list of the key-value pairs by using an Iterator object on the set of keys.

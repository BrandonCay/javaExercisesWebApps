Exercise O16        

Using the following definition of the abstract class ChangeMaker:
abstract class ChangeMaker

            {

                        private int  val1;

private int  val2;

public  ChangeMaker(  )

{

            val1  =  0;

            val2 = 0;

}

public  ChangeMaker(int n1, int n2 )

{

            val1  =  n1;

            val2 = n2;

}

public int getVal1(   )

{

            return val1;

}

public int getVal2(   )

{

            return val2;

}

public void  setValues( int num1,  int  num2)

{

            val1  =  num1;

            val2  =   num2;

}

public abstract void  makeChanges(   );            // abstract method

                        @Override

public String toString(   )

{

                                    String  s  =       "\nval1="  +  val1 + "\nval2 ="  + val2;

                                     return( s );

}

            }

          Define a class named Exercise O16A with the method main that doe the following:

Define the object obj1 by using an anonymous class that extends the abstract class ChangeMaker as follows:
This object is initialized with the default constructor.
Method makeChanges is defined as follows:  It increments the value of each instance variable by 1.
Call the method makeChanges( ) on this object and then print it.
Define the object obj2 by using an anonymous class that extends the abstract class ChangeMaker as follows:
This object is initialized with the value 3 for val1, and 4 for val2.
Method makeChanges is defined as follows:  It increments the value of each instance variable by 5.
Call the method makeChanges( ) on this object and then print it.
 

Using the following definition of the interface Expression:
            public  interface Expression

            {

                        void  saySomething(    );

            }

           Define a class named Exercise O16B with the method main that doe the following:

Define and instantiate the object obj1 by using an anonymous class that implements the interface Expression with the following definition of the method saySomething:
void  saySomething(   )

{

            System.out.println( "I feel good");

}

Call the mothod saySomething on this object.
Define the object obj2 by using an anonymous class that implements the interface Expression with the following definition of the method saySomething:
void  saySomething(   )

{

            System.out.println( "I do not feel well");

}

Call the mothod saySomething on this object.
